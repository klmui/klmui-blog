excerpt: '16-year olds have higher crash rates than drivers of any age. With new advances in VR technology, people have sought to use it for educational purposes. In this case, we are using it to help people drive by providing an immersive VR experience to help reduce anxiety when they get behind the wheel. Teachers can also use this app to organize their classroom and assign practice exams to students.'

When I took Drivers-ed as many others have, no technology was used to organize the classroom. Passing the written test and then moving to behind-the-wheels is a huge step. Drive-360 aims to keep classrooms connected and alleviate the fears of the written exam and going behind-the-wheel. 

Drive 360 helps students in driverâ€™s education classes learn the rules of driving by immersing them into interactive VR environments. It also provides a mobile-platform for instructors to create classrooms to help manage their drivers-education classes. Also, users can post tips, read their state's driving manual, and take practice exams. 

If classrooms wanted to implement this, it would be possible since many students have cell phones already. Then, all they have to do is get a Google Cardboard device for VR streaming! They cost $25 for two devices, which is cheap compared to devices like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive (hundreds of dollars).

Thanks for making it here! This was one of the toughest apps I had to create. The class I was in taught Android Studio, but my group was ambitious and decided to do a VR app. So, we combined both Unity and Android Studio. Learning Unity, C#, Android Studio, and Firebase was fun and challenging! My group and I presented today! We had everything perfect for the presentation, in my opinion, but I learned a critical lesson today. Always test your application before a live demo. I felt like Elon Musk when he claimed that the Cyber Truck's windows were resistant to the sledgehammer, but it still broke. The ability to adapt during a presentation is also something I learned today. If you are interested in checking out the source code for the full app, click [here](https://github.com/klmui/Drive360).
