Hey everyone! Around The World is my Spring Break project. This web application is for anyone who wants to track their memories with their friends. Start a new "collection," invite your friends to your "collection," and start logging your experiences! If you're feeling adventurous, start exploring collections today.

I made this application with my friend Harry over the course of a week. It was definitely challenging, and I hope to log my challenges as well as how I made this app in the "projects" tab of my website. I am also looking forward to using a website called DevPost.com to log all of my projects. 

I have a lot of upcoming features for this application. If you want to contribute, please feel free to email me at klmui@wisc.edu.
