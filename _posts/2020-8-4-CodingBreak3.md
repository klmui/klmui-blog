<h3><u>Artic Code Vault</u></h3>
You can check which GitHub repositories are stored in the Artic Vault by going to your profile and hovering over the badge that says 'Artic Vault Code Contributor'. If it's not there, you should expand on your projects, and they may add your repository to the Artic Code Vault in the future!
