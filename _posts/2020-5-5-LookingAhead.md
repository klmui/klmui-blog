<h3>Steps I will take to get my dream internship</h3>
As a CS major, the summer before junior year is one of the most important summers. Some hope to build their resumes by doing side projects, practice hundreds of LeetCode problems, or gain experience at an internship.

At this point, some things are kind of up in the air due to COVID-19. However, I hope to be in Madison for my internship at Forward Health Group. To be honest, I am not the most confident about my programming skills despite how often I do projects and challenging courses. However, I am optimistic about my ability to go through with things and have fun while I am at it. So, I will be listing out some steps besides doing an internship that I will take to land my dream internship in software engineering for the summer of 2021. I hope you guys find this somewhat insightful.

> **1. Read Cracking the Coding Interview**

> **2. Practice LeetCode problems**

> **3. Learn more about web frameworks such as Vue.js and Ionic**

> **4. Finish at least two of the projects I have planned for the summer**

> **5. Help out with an actual entrepreneur's software and help launch it**

> **6. Assist a graduate student with VR development**

<h3>Other summer plans and goals</h3>
This may seem like a lot due to an internship as well as summer courses, but I don't think I will have anything to do for the first few weeks after the end of my finals. As much of a workaholic as I may seem, I hope to go to Devil's Lake in Wisconsin as well as a road trip to California with my friends. As someone who loves to code, I believe that it essential to take some time off and go on adventures with friends/family. However, with the current situation, this may not be possible.

I'm not sure if you guys can relate to this, but I became extremely lazy (physically) after a couple of months in college. I used to run competitively a lot, but I am always working or procrastinating now. Since all of my classes are online (due to COVID-19) and I am back at home, I find that I don't even have to leave my house at all. This made me realize that I should start to set up a small exercising schedule and get back to do doing what I love. 

Another thing that I will have to work on is my sleep schedule. After I came back from Madison, I realized that I could just sleep in and watch the lectures at my own convenience. However, this backfired when I realized that I was behind on one week of lectures. So, if I woke up at 1 PM and started watching lectures at 2 PM, I would finish by 5 PM. My friends and I tend to keep working on homework or projects until substantial progress is made, which is usually until 2 or 3 in the morning. My goal is to go back to a normal sleeping schedule so I can be as effient as possible! 

Stay tuned to find out how well (or how terribly) I can achieve my goals this summer to make myself a better person both mentally and physically. Feel free to comment on your summer goals/tasks!
